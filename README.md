# Aggressive Tweet Analyzer - WIP

Final project for the Data Analytics bootcamp of Ironhack - WIP

**Notebooks guide**:
- 0_Iteration1: first attempt at building a model
- 1_EDA_and_Preprocessing: EDA, preprocessing and tokenization of the training datasets and of the evaluation dataset. The evaluation dataset contains the comments from Kevin Spacey's last 3 instagram posts. I scraped them myself with Instaloader. 
- 2_Training: I am using a pre-trained BERT model (bert-base-uncased). My intention was to fine-tune it with 8 datasets that include different types of bullying (aggression, attack, sexism, racism, etc), but I found that the model's performance was better if I fine-tuned it only with one dataset. So in the end, I only used the aggression dataset. All the data (raw data, clean data, tokenized data and the evaluation data) can be found on Google Drive (see below). 
- 3_Evaluation: in the previous notebook I evaluated the model with a split of test data from the aggression dataset. But in this notebook I test it with the evaluation dataset that I scraped from Kevin Spacey's Instagram account. 
- 4_App: contains the code for extracting and classifying tweets that I later added to the Flask project. 

All the data can be found here: https://bit.ly/375FmaJ

All the weights of the models I built are here: https://bit.ly/3ycAU63. The final version is 'aggression_dataset_1epoch.h5'
